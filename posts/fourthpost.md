I’m not sure if it will be similar but I just finished a warrior dash this past weekend that was the same distance as the one you will be attempting. I’m going to offer my advice based off of my experience. Also the obstacles you listed appear similar.

1. Hill sprints! Look at the course where the run will be held. Is it on a ski hill or does it have a lot of hills? If the answer is yes then I can tell you that will be the hardest part of the entire run. Prepare yourself by doing hill sprints.
2. Sprints! You want to be able to dash between the obstacles, also make sure you have a solid running foundation though (like an easy 4 miles).
3. The obstacles look a lot harder than they are. You will breeze through these, it will be the hills between the obstacles that catch you off guard.
4. Where old shoes, old clothes, and buy a pair of cheap sunglasses (the glasses help with the sun and also while sliding through the mud).
5. Don’t be afraid to get dirty! I watched so many people walk around the mud pit where you have to crawl under the barbed wire because they didn’t want to get dirty.
6. Tie your shoes tight, nothing worse than losing a shoe in 2 feet deep mud halfway through the race!
