Majority of people do all the wrong things to prepare for a mud run. One thing we need to understand is that such races are not just for running, you are required to overcome a lot of obstacles while running [these kinds of races](http://mudruntips.com/what-is-a-mud-run/).

So just running long miles every day as part of the training will not work and you will be in for a rude awakening. Following are some of the points worth considering if you are preparing for a mud run race event.

## Prepare like an Athlete:

Your training needs to be focused around performance. As discussed earlier, mud runs are not just about simple running. It is actually running and overcoming obstacles at the same time. So you need to have an increased conditioning, strength, mobility, flexibility and need to improve overall body composition.

If you’re serious about this race and you want to really push yourself to the end and actually be a competitor, you’ll want to have the following qualities:

* Power
* Strength
* Athleticism
* Speed
* Endurance

You need to take a short sprints like 400m or 800m, repeat again and again. Alternatively you can do hill sprints. There is no better way to strengthen your legs than hill sprints. Just find yourself a hill which is not too steep, just at the angle of 30-35 degree is good enough and one that stretches about 30-50 yards up. Start with some 4-5 reps and increase it all the way to 15-20 reps.

This will help you to build up some major conditioning for your challenge race. Blend it with some strength training in the gym and you will have the perfect preparation for the mud race.

## Mental Preparation

You must believe in yourself that it is worth doing and your commitment level should be very strong. Every session you train yourself, you must be ready and willing to take it to the next level. You must figure out the reason why you want to do this race so that you keep yourself motivated all the time.

Write down your major goals and have it somewhere you can see them every day. Just training your body will not work; you need to train your mind as well for the race.

## Eat Right

You need to incorporate lean protein everyday at least once in your diet. Green leafy vegetables and calcium rich food is also highly recommended. Cut down fatty foods like burgers, pizza, soda, candy and french fries.



## Preparation on the Day of the Mud Run:

**Dress As Per the Occasion**

Make sure you don’t wear loose cotton t-shirt because once you get wet and dirty in the mud your loose cotton t-shirt will become heavy and will cause more resistance while running.

Your clothes should be tight to your body and not at all hanging. Follow the same rule for your shorts. Make sure your shorts are tight around your waist. So that it wouldn’t get pull down by the weight of mud on it.

**Shoes**

Probably one of the most important things to consider before going for the mud run race is wearing the right kind of shoes. It would be an embarrassing situation to lose your shoes in the mud while trying to race.

[New Balance Minimus Trail Running Shoes](http://amzn.to/2bCDvjF) (available for men and women) are the most recommended for this kind of event. They are very light weight, provide great support while running and jumping. 

The shoes, inspite of being in the water or mud, will not slow you down. Because of the welded seams you can wear them without socks. They remain really tight to your foot and when you step in the mud they will not come off.

**Stay Hydrated**

Once you enter the place of the event, you are not allowed to carry water bottles. You need to ensure that you drink some water before entering in the race and they even have hydration station at various points during the race. Make sure you remain hydrated because it is found that many people don’t drink enough water and get dehydrated in the sun.

**Protect your knees**

Crawling is a typical part of a mud race. And if you do not have something to protect your knees, you might hurt them and that will provide a hindrance in your running. Wear leggings or some knee supporter if the rules of the race allows it.

**Visualize Finishing the Race**

Visualizing all the time that you are passing that finishing line will motivate and pump you up for the show. So rather than thinking of the obstacle and hindrances on your way, visualize that you have successfully completed the race will boost your confidence level and consequently your action and the result.
